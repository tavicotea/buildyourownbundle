Documentation Approach
1. Introduction
The goal of the project is to create a "Build Your Own Bundle" configurator and an order summary page based on user selections.

2. HTML Implementation
HTML5 was used to create the basic structure of the pages. The configurator page includes product cards, each with add buttons. The summary page displays the selected products and the total price.

3. CSS Styling
CSS3 was used to style the pages according to the Figma design. Flexbox was used to arrange elements on the page, and media queries were used to ensure responsiveness on different screen sizes.

4. JavaScript Functionality
JavaScript was used to add products to the cart and calculate the total price and distances. Logic was implemented to display the order summary and popups confirming product additions.

5. Additional Functionality
A popup was implemented that appears from the side and disappears after 5 seconds, informing the user that the product was added to the bundle.
